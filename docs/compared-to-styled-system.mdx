## Pseudo Selector Props

Inspired by [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com), System Props supports pseudo selectors as props, which can be configured via `createSystem`. This takes your system props to the next level by giving you the ability to style the element at different states, such as hover, focus, disabled, and more.

```js
<Box color="white" bg="periwinkle" _hover={{ bg: 'seafoamgreen' }} />
```

## Shorthand Property Support

System Props will parse shorthand properties, such as `margin`, `padding`, `border`, and `boxShadow` for the theme scales used within it. For example, to define a border width, style, and color (using a theme color) with Styled System, you had to use multiple props:

```jsx
<Box border="1px solid" borderColor="$gray400" marginX="$2" marginY="$3" />

// Yields:
// .Box-hash {
//   border: 1px solid;
//   border-color: #858687;
//   margin-left: 15px;
//   margin-right: 15px;
//   margin-top: 10px;
//   margin-bottom: 10px;
// }
```

System Props will parse the border shorthand for theme theme color value:

```jsx
<Box border="1px solid $gray400" m="$3 $2" />

// Yields:
// .Box-hash {
//   border: 1px solid #858687;
//   margin: 10px 15px;
// }
```

## Prefix design tokens with `$`

System Props, like Styled System, supports numeric scales in theme. For example, `theme.space` is frequently defined as an array, like so:

```js
const theme = {
  space: [0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64]
}

<Box marginLeft={3} />
```

System Props will parse `3` as `theme.space[3]`, which yields `16` (or `16px`). This can be confusing since you might expect `marginLeft={3}` to yield `3px`.

To eliminate this confusion, System Props supports (and recommends!) prefixing theme values with `$` to clarify when you're using theme tokens. This is optional, and theme tokens can be referenced without them.

```jsx
<Box
  m="$2 $3"
  color="$gray300"
  bg="$blue900"
  border="1px solid $blue700"
  borderRadius="$round"
/>
```

## Quick Access to Theme with Function Value

If at any time you need access to the entire theme object, every system prop can take a value as a function where its argument is the theme:

```jsx
<Box border={theme => `1px solid ${theme.colors.gray400}`}

// Supports responsive syntax, too!
<Box
  bg={theme => ({
    _: theme.colors.blue,
    sm: theme.colors.darkblue
  })}
/>

<Box
  bg={{
    _: theme => theme.colors.blue,
    sm: 'tomato'
  }}
/>
```

## Strict Mode

Particularly useful for design systems. You may prefer that exclusively theme values are supported with system props. Enabling the `strict` confiugration option in `createSystem` to accomplish this.

```jsx
const system = createSystem({strict: true})

<Box color="blue200" />  // ✅ Theme value
<Box color="tomato" />   // ❌ Not theme value
```
