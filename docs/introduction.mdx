System Props let's you add props to your components to alter their styles. Save time by styling components via props!

System Props is **great** for design systems.

This package has two main components: `createSystem`, which defines how your System Props work, and a collection of system prop groups, such as `space`, `color`, and `layout` to make it really easy to get started. As a component library maintainer, you can decide when and if each prop group is appropriate for you system.

## Theming

Most system props are paired with a scale in your theme. For example, you can reference any key in your `colors` object, and System Props will yield that value. If you run into a case where you need to access the theme outside of this pairing, every system prop can be passed a function that's called with your theme.

```jsx
const theme = {
  colors: {
    red: {
      10: '#ff0'
    }
  }
}

<Box color="red.10" />
<Box color={theme => theme.colors.red[10]} />

// Both yield the same styles
// .hash { color: #ff0 }
```

If System Props can't find a value in your theme, the value will pass through. If you'd like to block non-theme values from working, you can set the `strict` option in `createStystem` to false.

## Custom Props

System Props can be extended for other CSS properties that aren't included in the library or replaced to work the way you want them to. You can create your own props for setting multiple CSS properties simultaneously or create alias shorthands for commonly used props.

```jsx
import { createSystem, space, color } from 'system-props';

const system = createSystem();

const Box = styled.div(
  system({
    ...color,
    ...space,
    // Create your own shorthand
    bgColor: color.backgroundColor,
    transform: true,
    h: {
      property: 'height',
      scale: 'sizes',
    },
    w: {
      property: 'width',
      scale: 'sizes',
    },
  })
);
```

## Responsive

Often when working on responsive layouts, it's useful to adjust styles along a singular dimension â€“ such as font-size, margin, padding, and width. Instead of manually managing media queries and adding nested style objects throughout a code base, Styled System offers a convenient shorthand syntax for adding responsive styles with a mobile-first approach. While this syntax can seem odd at first, it can become a powerful way to manage responsive typography and layouts.

All style utilities add props that accept arrays as values for mobile-first responsive styles.

```jsx
<Box
  // responsive font size
  fontSize={[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]}
  // responsive margin
  m={[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]}
/>

// Also supports plain objects as values,
// where the keys match a property in theme.breakpoints
<Box p={{_: 1, sm: 2, md: 3, lg: 4}} />
```

## Developer Experience

System Props are an efficient way to create style and layout components on the fly. No need for a separate CSS file or a new styled component! With shorthand support, TypeScript support, and approachable methods of using theme and responsive breakpoints, System Props make simple styling tasks trivial.
